## About
APM is an open source, free, minimal, simple and secure password manager. APM have an server-client structure.
Server acts like an database and stores the **AES-256** encrypted data, all encryption is made on the client
so an attacker won't be able to steal any data if they hack into the server. 

### Servers
Each server have an collection of keys, keys can be generated by the users on the web interface.
Keys gets stored on the server, valid keys can be used to access the API which is a simple
API with only few functions, since the server is just a database there isn't much that it does.
See the [server repo](https://github.com/Awesome-Password-Manager/server) for more information on the API.

### Clients
Clients provides users an interface, users provide an APM server and a valid key for that server.
Using these, client communicates with the API and uses it as a storage for all the password
containers.

Currently APM has only one offical client and its the [node-client](https://github.com/Awesome-Password-Manager/node-client),
check out its README for more information.

#### Building your own client
You can build your own APM client and open an issue so I can add it to this README.
Here's the requirements for an APM client:
- Simple commands such as "add", "delete", "read" to manage the password containers
- Human readable storage format such as JSON to store the containers
- AES-256 encryption with user provided password(s)
- Ability to store encrypted data on the server using the API
- Ability to backup the encrypted data stored on the server
- Must let users to specify their server(s) and their key(s)

Password containers consists of at least these three things:
- Container name
- Username
- Password

## Should you use APM?
I love building my own things, I know they are not perfect and never be. I will be using this password 
manager because, well I made it, I know its safe, its free and I can make it better any
time I want.

But you as an random guy who somehow found yourself here, you probably shouldn't use this as theres
much more better options out there, but if you want a minimal and simple password manager that
you can play around with any time you want, well you may look into it.
